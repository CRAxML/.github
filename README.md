# Overview of organization

Please contact John Wise (jwise@physics.gatech.edu) if you are experiencing any issues with access to the organization.

## Issues

Please use issues to start brainstorming sessions for collaborations. Usage of labels to indicate which group is proposing and/or working on the project is encouraged. Additional labels may include information about what type of ML is being implemented or talked about in the project.

## Repositories

Use separate repositories for different collaborations so that those involved can pull and push to their individual project as needed. Refrain from pushing large data files to repositories. Third-party applications such as Dropbox are encouraged for sharing of large data files or directories.

## Teams

Teams may be useful for collaborators to keep their issues focused. 

### This organization is a work in progress, so please let the organizers know of any suggestions for improvement!
